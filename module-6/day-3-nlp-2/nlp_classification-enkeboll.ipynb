    "We'll begin by considering a small subset of English: words for animals. Our task is to be able to write computer programs to find similarities among these words and the creatures they designate. To do this, we might start by making a spreadsheet of some animals and their characteristics. For example:\n",

(The values themselves are simply based on my own judgment. Your taste in cuteness and evaluation of size may differ significantly from mine. As with all data, these data are simply a mirror reflection of the person who collected them.)\n",
    "\n",
    "These values give us everything we need to make determinations about which animals are similar (at least, similar in the properties that we've included in the data). Try to answer the following question: Which animal is most similar to a capybara? You could go through the values one by one and do the math to make that evaluation, but visualizing the data as points in 2-dimensional space makes finding the answer very intuitive:\n",

One way of calculating how \"far apart\" two points are is to find their *Euclidean distance*. (This is simply the length of the line that connects the two points.) For points in two dimensions, Euclidean distance can be calculated with the following Python function:"

    "Modeling animals in this way has a few other interesting properties. For example, you can pick an arbitrary point in \"animal space\" and then find the animal closest to that point. If you imagine an animal of size 25 and cuteness 30, you can easily look at the space to find the animal that most closely fits that description: the chicken.\n",

The vector space of animals in this section has two *dimensions*, by which I mean that each vector in the space has two numbers associated with it (i.e., two columns in the spreadsheet). The fact that this space has two dimensions just happens to make it easy to *visualize* the space by drawing a 2D plot. But most vector spaces you'll work with will have more than two dimensions—sometimes many hundreds. In those cases, it's more difficult to visualize the \"space,\" but the math works pretty much the same."

    "\n",
    "To answer that, we have to back up a bit and ask the question: what does *meaning* mean? No one really knows, but one theory popular among computational linguists, computer scientists and other people who make search engines is the [Distributional Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributional_semantics), which states that:\n",

    "    It'll be really hot tomorrow!\n",

(Likewise, the words `yesterday`, `today`, `tomorrow` and `Tuesday` must be related, since they occur in the context of a word indicating a temperature.)\n",

    "\n",
    "So how do we turn this insight from the Distributional Hypothesis into a system for creating general-purpose vectors that capture the meaning of words? Maybe you can see where I'm going with this. What if we made a *really big* spreadsheet that had one column for every context for every word in a given source text. Let's use a small source text to begin with, such as this excerpt from Dickens:\n",
    "\n",
    "    It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a spreadsheet might look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![dickens contexts](http://static.decontextualize.com/snaps/best-of-times.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The spreadsheet has one column for every possible context, and one row for every word. The values in each cell correspond with how many times the word occurs in the given context. The numbers in the columns constitute that word's vector, i.e., the vector for the word `of` is\n",
    "\n",
    "    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n",
    "    \n",
    "Because there are ten possible contexts, this is a ten dimensional space! It might be strange to think of it, but you can do vector arithmetic on vectors with ten dimensions just as easily as you can on vectors with two or three dimensions, and you could use the same distance formula that we defined earlier to get useful information about which vectors in this space are similar to each other. In particular, the vectors for `best` and `worst` are actually the same (a distance of zero), since they occur only in the same context (`the ___ of`):\n",
    "\n",
    "    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    "    \n",
    "Of course, the conventional way of thinking about \"best\" and \"worst\" is that they're *antonyms*, not *synonyms*. But they're also clearly two words of the same kind, with related meanings (through opposition), a fact that is captured by this distributional model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contexts and dimensionality\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, in a corpus of any reasonable size, there will be many thousands if not many millions of possible contexts. It's difficult enough working with a vector space of ten dimensions, let alone a vector space of a million dimensions! It turns out, though, that many of the dimensions end up being superfluous and can either be eliminated or combined with other dimensions without significantly affecting the predictive power of the resulting vectors. The process of getting rid of superfluous dimensions in a vector space is called [dimensionality reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction), and most implementations of count-based word vectors make use of dimensionality reduction so that the resulting vector space has a reasonable number of dimensions (say, 100—300, depending on the corpus and application).\n",
    "\n",
    "The question of how to identify a \"context\" is itself very difficult to answer. In the toy example above, we've said that a \"context\" is just the word that precedes and the word that follows. Depending on your implementation of this procedure, though, you might want a context with a bigger \"window\" (e.g., two words before and after), or a non-contiguous window (skip a word before and after the given word). You might exclude certain \"function\" words like \"the\" and \"of\" when determining a word's context, or you might [lemmatize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatisation) the words before you begin your analysis, so two occurrences with different \"forms\" of the same word count as the same context. These are all questions open to research and debate, and different implementations of procedures for creating count-based word vectors make different decisions on this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GloVe vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "But you don't have to create your own word vectors from scratch! Many researchers have made downloadable databases of pre-trained vectors. One such project is Stanford's [Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe)](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/). These 300-dimensional vectors are included with spaCy, and they're the vectors we'll be using for the rest of this tutorial."
